<p>What single stock ETFs are available in Canada?</p>

<h2>Assistant:</h2>
<p>Single-stock ETFs in Canada are exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to the performance of an individual company's stock. Unlike traditional broad-market ETFs, these focus on one stock and typically incorporate strategies like covered calls (to generate higher yields through options premiums) or leverage (to amplify daily returns, often 2x or -2x). They are relatively new in the Canadian market, with launches accelerating in 2024-2025, and are listed on exchanges like the TSX or Cboe Canada. Major providers include Harvest Portfolios (with high-income covered call options), Purpose Investments (yield-focused covered calls), and LongPoint Asset Management (leveraged and inverse leveraged). Note that these products can be higher-risk due to options or leverage, and investors should review prospectuses for details like management fees, reset mechanics, and tax implications.</p>

<p>Below is a comprehensive list based on available offerings as of August 2025. This includes both Canadian and U.S. underlying stocks, as many are accessible to Canadian investors.</p>

<h3>Harvest Portfolios High Income Shares ETFs</h3>
<p>Harvest offers two main series: standard High Income Shares (covered calls for yield) and Enhanced High Income Shares (use modest 1.25x leverage to write additional calls for higher potential income). Many are available in CAD or USD units.</p>
